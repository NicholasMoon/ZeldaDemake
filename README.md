# ZeldaDemake  
This demake of the original Legend of Zelda is built in the Inform 7 interactive fiction language, which emulates the structure of early PC text adventures such as Colossal Cave Adventure. We made this game for a couple reasons. First, to frame the original Legend of Zelda within the context and its placement in the early history of video games, particularly its role in branching out of the adventure genre to incorporate action elements and computer graphics. It also serves to contrast the imaginative and role-playing elements of historical text adventures with those found in the NES release of The Legend of Zelda. Finally, this demake offers players freedom and exploration, and also takes inspiration from swordless runs and the 2015 game Undertale to offer a pacifist option to play.
